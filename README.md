# html-escape-sequences

Use HTML escape sequences with evancz/elm-html.

Just replace `Html.text` with the included `text'` function.

Supports all Unicode characters and recognizes decimal, hexadecimal and named escape sequences.

No more hunting around for Unicode symbols! Also useful when fetching escaped Unicode entities from an API.

This version (1.0.3) works with Elm version 0.16.
