# html-escape-sequences

Use HTML escape sequences with elm-html.

Just replace `Html.text` with the included `text'` function.

Supports all Unicode characters and recognizes decimal, hexadecimal and non-digit escape sequences.

No more hunting around for Unicode symbols! Also useful when fetching escaped Unicode entities from an API.

This version works with Elm version 0.16.
